* Communication with the advanced GPT3 model API
* Ability to ask the AI for help regarding any programming language
* Translation of code to another langauge

Limitations:
* Does not connect one question with another.

2. cd into the client directory and run *npm run dev*. 
3. cd into the server directory and run *npm run server*
